# Data-Privacy-Legal-Hackathon
International Legal Hackathon 
Legal Privacy Hackathon for Computational Law and the governance of identity

Jan 28 + 29 2021- To start the year the new ANCR WG at Kantara is hosting an event spanning 2+ days to continue a long tradition of International Data Privacy Legal Hacking,( in fact, this is how the consent receipt came to exist.)

Attend the event and tune in to see how notice and consent standards reverse the burden of privacy policies by placing the burden on services to notify with reciepts to provide standardized notice so that consent can be meaningful and meet the highest of standard for medical research and Covid tracking transparency, to parental consent over e-learning platforms and services like Google Ad-Tech. 

There will be multiple demo’s which will aim to inspire innovation and open service collaboration with EU Data Governance Projects (NGI DAPSI and eSSIF funded projects) working with the same technical standards for decentralised and dynamic data control for the most pressing consent (and non-consent use cases. 
Notice and Consent Tech demo’s presentations and implementation solve the biggest lie on the Internet - Surveillance Capitalism - the foundational objective of this work. 
Demonstrating standards based approached to solve collective challenges with consented surveillance for public privacy online (and off).

Re-writing/Dynamic Terms and Conditions according to public privacy standards

Covering Topics (Demo’s and Use Case Pilots )

Consent Receipts used as Reverse cookies - 
International Privacy UI
 Active State privacy signaling for privacy that people expect by services provided with open public notice and consent receipt gateway, an EU funded NGI Project)
all enabled by extending data governance (notice and consent) standards with technical standards and MyData Control practices for systems we can trust. 


2Factor Notice for Meaningful Online Consent (2Factor Consent) providing proof of consent and evidence 
Separation of Concerns :
making privacy rights an independent public service, rather than dependent on service provider privacy policies 
 international standards are required for separation of concerns (the ethics of data control). These standards provide decentralised privacy rights can be used independently of the service providers with receipts without the need to ever read a privacy policy 
(See receipt types below)
