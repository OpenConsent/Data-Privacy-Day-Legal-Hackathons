ANCR -  legal receipts - Hacking Enforceable` Privacy Rights


Background on the ANCR WG 

We are ecstatic \ to be able to celebrate the success of these initiatives along with the legal and policy change, we have hoped one day would result in enforceable privacy rights.  To this end, 7 years of volunteer contributions to the the Kantara Initiative on the Consent Receipt Specification.
April 2020 - ISO SC 27 voted for the consent receipt specification to become an ISO standard ISO 27560 Consent Record Information Structure 
May 4th, 2020 GDPR Consent Laws became Enforceable. 
With these two results alone, we can now start to Decentralise Data Governance. 
Not too mention 
June 2020 - ISO 29184 :  The ISO standard the consent notice receipt was written  was published with the consent notice receipt in the appendix, realising (with enforceable law) the legal nature of the consent receipt. 
Nov 2020 The Data Governance Act Draft was released for EU Single Market 
Dec 2020 The Consumer Canadian Privacy Act - 

Now the infrastructure we have so longed lobbied for, is here. Today, for the first International Privacy Day ever, the publically required infrastructure for people to access and use privacy rights, independent of services can be built, at a time when Covid threatens us all.  


Privacy Week Satellite - The Hero’s of Enforceable Privacy
