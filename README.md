Background 

This is a very special year. we are ecstatic to be able to celebrate the success of our winning hackathon initiatives along with the legal and policy changes that make privacy enforceable with international standards. 

2020 - Hypersped the international and multi-domain privacy standards 
* April 2020 - ISO SC 27 voted for the consent receipt specification to become an ISO standard ISO 27560 Consent Record Information Structure 
* May 4th, 2020 GDPR Consent Laws became Enforceable. [With these two results alone, we can now start to Decentralise Data Governance.] 

Legal Standards Matured in 2020
* June 2020 - ISO 29184 :  The ISO standard the consent notice receipt was written  was published with the consent notice receipt in the appendix, realising (with enforceable law) the legal nature of the consent receipt. 
* Nov 2020 The Data Governance Act Draft was released for EU Single Market 
* Dec 2020 The Consumer Canadian Privacy Act - 

Today, finally with the Data Goverance Act, and CoE 101 +  the infrastructure we have so longed lobbied for, is here. Today, for the first International Privacy Day ever, the publically required infrastructure for people to access and use privacy rights, independent of services can be built, at a time when Covid threatens us all.  


Privacy Week Satellite - The Hero’s of Enforceable Privacy

This Year -  Privacy Week Sessions are a satellite event to  Computers Privacy & Data Protection conference being held on Jan 27-29.   ‘

This year ushers in the age of Decentralised Data Governance, a new category of privacy and security where standards provide data governance for services, relieving the burden from organisations to make their own, and people from privacy policies.  (representing the immense cost of privacy and the sacrifices we take to make data flow,.

The Invitation for March Event 
We are inviting stakeholders interest

The agenda  is co-created by participants and posted on Jan 20th, with limited open access and participant provided invitations are given a priority.  Any remaining capacity is released on Jan 25th.

A core focus is on decentralised data governance interoperability (using standards) and the 2021 Data Governance Landscape.  Government transparency and transparency over surveillance online has been a critical challenge to address in the last decade.   International standards address these challenges..
