# Data-Privacy-Legal-Hackathon
International Legal Hackathon 
Legal Privacy Hackathon for Computational Law and the governance of identity

Jan 28 + 29 2021- To start the year the new ANCR WG at Kantara is hosting an event spanning 2+ days to continue a long tradition of International Data Privacy Legal Hacking,( in fact, this is how the consent receipt came to exist.)

Attend the event and tune in to see how notice and consent standards reverse the burden of privacy policies by placing the burden on services to notify with reciepts to provide standardized notice so that consent can be meaningful and meet the highest of standard for medical research and Covid tracking transparency, to parental consent over e-learning platforms and services like Google Ad-Tech. 

There will be multiple demo’s which will aim to inspire innovation and open service collaboration with EU Data Governance Projects (NGI DAPSI and eSSIF funded projects) working with the same technical standards for decentralised and dynamic data control for the most pressing consent (and non-consent use cases. 
Notice and Consent Tech demo’s presentations and implementation solve the biggest lie on the Internet - Surveillance Capitalism - the foundational objective of this work. 
Demonstrating standards based approached to solve collective challenges with consented surveillance for public privacy online (and off).
Computational Legal Hackathon 
Re-writing/Dynamic Terms and Conditions according to public privacy standards
Automating notice contract receipts for dynamic data economy 
Privacy broadcasting 
Standardised public information privacy service end points for easy legal and technical policy enhancement
Covering Topics (Demo’s and Use Case Pilots ) 
EU Skills and Mobility (aNG governance interoperability)
Immunisation Passports and Covid Credentials (DAPSI Project)
Childrens Surveillance in e;Learning platforms (the Google Ad-Tech Cookie Killer) 
Consent Receipts used as Reverse cookies - 
International Privacy UI
 Active State privacy signaling for privacy that people expect by services provided with open public notice and consent receipt gateway, an EU funded NGI Project)
all enabled by extending data governance (notice and consent) standards with technical standards and MyData Control practices for systems we can trust. 


2Factor Notice for Meaningful Online Consent (2Factor Consent) providing proof of consent and evidence 
Separation of Concerns :
making privacy rights an independent public service, rather than dependent on service provider privacy policies 
 international standards are required for separation of concerns (the ethics of data control). These standards provide decentralised privacy rights can be used independently of the service providers with receipts without the need to ever read a privacy policy 
(See receipt types below)

Smart Species has  partnered with the Open Consent Group and many communities of interest to champion decentralised community semantics to pioneer collaborative mydata identifier - governance innovation.  Calling communities to action for  the governance of identity management, and we have done so for more than 15 years, through many industry presentations and conferences. But most importantly through  Hackathons.. Active in the identity management industry community since 2005 Identity Commons and started Working Group on this Topic in 2006  - Called Identity Trust with a Charter. - and proceeded the  Identity Trust Community Interest Company Surveillance Trust Registry and a long history of social + experiential  (example) Hackathon Research - in which this work evolved to the Kantara Initiative and into the Kantara Consent Receipt, which eventually found its way into the MyData Ultrahack - and the winning Consent Gateway,  An effort that began when OKF started sharing an office with Species  Species at Cable St.   The Open Knowledge Foundation MyData -Open Data Work Group and the  Hackathon in Berlin  (2014) where  Mark Lizar first met Jogi and  Kai (can be seen).  The Consent Receipt winning hack s in London UK (at the Cable st offices) -  where we were working out what global artefact was needed in the  standards layer to ‘data’ enable privacy rights. 
Why did we do all of this?    To provide the ability for people to auto find the  privacy information, to automate the human rights.  - A task the AdvCIS group at Kantara - the W3C Data Privacy Control CG and the Unified (mydata) Control Semantics  Schema Task Force at ToiP, ISO and DIACC’s Pan-Canadian Trust Framework (and many other MyData Operator Service Provider)   are focused on delivering in 2020.
