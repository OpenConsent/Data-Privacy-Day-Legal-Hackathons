This is a very special year. we are ecstatic to be able to celebrate the success of our winning hackathon initiatives along with the legal and policy changes that make privacy enforceable with international standards.

Finally with the Data Goverance Act, and CoE 101 +  the infrastructure we have so longed lobbied for, is here. Jan 30, for the first International Privacy Day ever, the publically sought after infrastructure for people to access and use privacy rights, independent of services can be built, at a time when Covid threatens us all.  

# 2020 - Hypersped the multi-domain privacy standards 
* April 2020 - ISO SC 27 voted for the consent receipt specification to become an ISO standard ISO 27560 Consent Record Information Structure 
* May 4th, 2020 GDPR Consent Laws became Enforceable. [With these two results alone, we can now start to Decentralise Data Governance.] 

# Legal Standards Matured in 2020
* June 2020 - ISO 29184 :  The ISO standard the consent notice receipt was written  was published with the consent notice receipt in the appendix, realising (with enforceable law) the legal nature of the consent receipt. 
* Nov 2020 The Data Governance Act Draft was released for EU Single Market 
* Dec 2020 The Consumer Canadian Privacy Act - 

# IN 2021 - We are co-creating the decentralised data governacnce landscape
